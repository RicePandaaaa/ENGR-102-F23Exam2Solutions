"""
Difference #1:
Top down has a focus on breaking down bigger tasks into smaller, more manageabel tasks
while bottom up has a focus on making small actionable tasks at the start and then categorizing them into bigger task "categories".

Difference #2:
Top down can lead to extremely specialized code since the code is based on the main task (parent tasks) while
bottown up can lead to straying away from the original goal.

Two Advantages:
 - Top Down:
   - Breaks down a large project into much more manageable code (less overwhelming)
   - Allows for easier task distribution if in a group
 - Bottom Up:
   - Allows you to plan out all the stuff you want to do and build on that (ensures you can implement everything necessary)
   - Lets you categorize tasks or distribute individual tasks based on indivdual strength
