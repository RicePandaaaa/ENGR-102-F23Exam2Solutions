# ENGR-102-F23Exam2Solutions

Howdy! These are solutions made by TA Anthony Pham and have been approved to be put on the multisection! For the additional practice problems set, some problems are duplcated so I opted to skip those. I also opted to skip one question (the fighting game question) since that is an extremely broad question. If you would like to see me work out these problems, please look at my videos that I've linked below!

If you believe there are any errors or you simply have questions, reach out to me on the <a href="https://tx.ag/taoserver">Discord server</a> or via email (anthony.ha.pham@tamu.edu)!

## Changes made

More Practice Problems, q05.py: I accidently used `total` instead of `count` for variance. The code has been updated to reflect the correct formula.
